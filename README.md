# Work-Day-Scheduler
Goal:

To be able to add important events to a daily planner in order to manage time effectively


Changes:
1. When I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
2. When I scroll down, I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
3. When I view the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
4. When I click into a time block, I can enter an event
5. When I click the save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage
6. When I refresh the page, the saved events persist
